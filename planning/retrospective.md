# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- **_Vagueness_**, Clear delegation and instructions are imperative for moving
  work forward.
- **_Incongruity_**, When one team member suggests an idea, that requires team
  members to move out of their comfort zone and this concept is unaccepted, this
  can trigger discrepancies in completing project goals.

## Continue Doing

- **_Shared common goals_**, Instill shared goals by ensuring that everyone
  understands what is expected of them in the project.
- **_Effective communication_**, To ensure fewer mistakes in completing
  projects.
- **_Frequent communication & adapting_**, Encourage team to air opinions and
  work through issues. Work with conflicting ideas by compromising and
  incorporating the best features of a concept to continue/create a better one.

## Start Doing

- **_Set expectation and explain clear process_**, If we donâ€™t make those norms
  clear for everyone, it'll risk creating an environment where people feel
  excluded, uncertain, or unwilling to contribute.
- **_Set or clarify goals_**, Make clear what the team is working toward and how
  you expect it to get there.

## Lessons Learned

- **_Don't be too hasty in resolving conflict_**, Take times in checking the
  details while solving the conflict on team repo, and pay attention to the
  details.
