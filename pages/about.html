              for a career in software development. We believe coding can help
              people in disadvantaged situations live up to their potential, get
              back control of their own lives and be an important change to
              their environment."

              society. We believe diversity is essential on IT company floors,
              which can be increased by hiring our graduates as junior web
              developers."
